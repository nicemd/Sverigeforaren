2011-07-08 The climbing goes on a vertical wall but is really delicate and technical in the upper part, which makes the actual experiencing of the route dificulty vary from 6c to 7a+.
The route was originally protected by 3 pitons only (nearly destroyed by corrosion, status by year 2010, now removed and replaced by 6 bolts). But even when those were new, one would have to be as fearless (or careless) as Daniel Bidner to just go for such a climb.

A direct approach to the route together with a proper belay station on the ledge up is a project, hopefully to complete this year (2011). /PY

In my opinion, you don't need to put up a belay station on the ledge. And I agree about the grade, we were thinking something like 6c+ or 7a. I've added a suggested + for now and we'll see what others think. Daniel was fearless. They don't come like that anymore. /JP
