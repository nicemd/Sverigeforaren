2008-12-07. It seems that the block is not loose at all. I tried really hard to take it down by using a 2.5m piece of 3" iron pipe as a lever (see the photos). But I could not move it not a millimeter.

But then again, I can't give any guarantee. So, it's smart to avoid using the block if possible.
